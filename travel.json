Sitting in the heart of the Champ de Mars in Paris, the wrought-iron tower was originally built to serve as the entrance to the 1889 World's Fair. Engineer Gustave Eiffel received much criticism for his design, with people calling it a monstrosity and an impossible task - at the time of construction, the 324-meter-tall tower (equivalent to an 81-story building) was the tallest structure in the world.",

The heart of the Acropolis is the Parthenon, a temple built to thank the gods for the victory over Persian invaders though it also served as the city treasury for a time. Other prominent buildings include the gateway Propylaea (which serves as the entrance to Acropolis, the Erechtheion Temple (dedicated to Athena and Poseidon), and the tiny but beautiful Temple of Athena Nike.",

If this doesn't sound ominous enough, the base of the mountain is also home to Aokigahara. Also known as 'The Suicide Forest,' this dense forest growing on hardened lava is home to ice caves, a combination that absorbs sound and creates an eerie feeling of solitude.",

Phuket boasts some of the best beaches in the country, with clean, soft, rolling sands and turquoise waters as far as the eye can see. Kata, Hat Karon, and Kamala beaches see a lot of tourists during the high season (November to February) but remain sleepy little villages once the rains arrive. Beautiful coral reefs line up the coastline, offering amazing opportunities for snorkeling and diving but also sea kayaking and island hopping.",

The pyramids and the Great Sphinx date back to the 26th century BCE and are Egypts most iconic attractions. The Pyramids of Giza are easy to access from Egypt's capital and  largest city, Cairo, which is equally fascinating to visit. Set on the banks of the Nile River, Cairo is a chaotic and buzzy place that appears to never slow down, even in the dead of night. Here, ancient history meets a modern metropolis and there is much to see and do, with a visit to the Egyptian Museum at the top of most lists.",
